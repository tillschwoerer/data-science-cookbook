# Käsespätzle

I am originally from the South of Germany, more precisely the region called Schwaben (Swabia). This region is famous for a lot of great things: e.g. Mercedes, Porsche, Jürgen Klinsmann, the saying "Wir können ALLES, außer Hochdeutsch", cleaning garbage bins from the inside, ... and last but not lease delicious food such as **Käsespätzle**.

Though it is possible to just buy **Spätzle** in any supermarket (either fresh or dried), I would likely recommend - for the full experience - to make your own Spätzle, and then adding cheese etc. on top of it. Making your own Spätzle certainly raises the overall cooking time.

## Stats
- Cooking Time: 30 minutes
- Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- 500 g of flour 
- 1 tablespoon of oil
- 250 ml of whater	Wasser
- 4 teespoons of salt
- 6	eggs
- 3 medium-sized onions
- 300 g shredded Emmentaler cheese

## Instructions
1. For the dough, mix the eggs, flour, oil and plenty of salt (approx. 4 teaspoons) with a dough hook. Depending on the size of the eggs, add the water until you have a thick batter.
2. In the meantime, bring salted water to the boil. Then press the dough through a dedicated spaetzle press into the boiling water. Alternatively, you can spread the dough on a board and scrape small pieces into the water with a knife. 
3. The spaetzle will rise again after a very short time in the water, "fish" them out of the water and place them in a bowl.
4. Add a little of the cheese to each portion of the finished spaetzle so that it is always evenly mixed. Add the next portion of spaetzle to the water and so on. Make sure that the cooking water contains enough salt, as the spaetzle will "soak it up" with the water.
5. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon from time to time, as the spaetzle could stick to the bottom.
6. Peel the onions, cut into rings and fry until dark brown. Then spread over the cheese spaetzle.

# Comments
I would recommend lettuce with it, and maybe some white whine or Hefeweizen beer.

Enjoy!
