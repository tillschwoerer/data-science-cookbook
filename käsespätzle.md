# Käsespätzle

I am originally from the South of Germany, more precisely the region called Schwaben (Swabia). This region is famous for a lot of great things: e.g. Mercedes, Porsche, Jürgen Klinsmann, the saying "Wir können ALLES, außer Hochdeutsch", cleaning garbage bins from the inside, ... and last but not lease delicious food such as **Käsespätzle**.

Though it is possible to just buy **Spätzle** in any supermarket (either fresh or dried), I would likely recommend - for the full experience - to make your own Spätzle, and then adding cheese etc. on top of it. Making your own Spätzle certainly raises the overall cooking time.
