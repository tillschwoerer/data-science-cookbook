## Ingredients
200 g of dry pasta (from durum wheat)

500 ml of water

2 tablespoons of tomato paste

150 g of hard cheese

3 cloves of garlic

3 tablespoons of olive oil

½ teaspoon of dried Italian herbs or oregano

½ teaspoon of salt.

## Instructions
Grate the cheese using a coarse grater.

Chop the garlic (not too finely).

The pasta-to-water ratio is very important: use 500 ml of water for 200 g of dry pasta.

Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a hot skillet. Add the oregano (or Italian herbs) and garlic. Sauté on medium heat for no more than a minute. The herbs and garlic should release their aroma into the oil. Do not overcook the garlic.

Add the tomato paste.

Gradually pour in the full amount of water, dissolving the tomato paste bit by bit. Add ½ teaspoon of salt. Bring the sauce to a boil.

Once the sauce is boiling, add all the pasta. Stir to make sure the pasta is fully covered by the liquid. Bring to a boil again.

Cover with a lid! Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Let the pasta cook in the sauce for 20 minutes under the lid. Do not lift the lid or stir the pasta during this time.

After 20 minutes, lift the lid. The pasta should be almost done.

Evenly sprinkle all the cheese on top. Pay special attention to covering the edges.

Cover again with the lid. Simmer on the same low heat for another 7–10 minutes.

After the time is up, remove the lid. The cheese should be nicely melted. Mix everything gently.

Serve immediately while hot.
