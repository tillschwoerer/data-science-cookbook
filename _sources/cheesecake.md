# Cheesecake

A dessert so rich it makes your bank account feel poor by comparison. This velvety, creamy show-off is what happens when cream cheese reaches its final, most evolved form. Serve it to guests and pretend it wasn’t mostly just sitting in the fridge for hours doing nothing.

## Stats
- Cooking Time: 1 hour (plus 4 hours of existential fridge time)
- Servings: 8-10 people, or one person with unresolved emotions

## Ingredients
- 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs (or whatever crumbles your crust)
- ¼ cup granulated sugar (for the illusion of sweetness)
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted (because of course it is)
- 4 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, softened (just like your resolve)
- 1 cup granulated sugar (again—because dessert)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (the potion of desserts)
- 4 large eggs (emotionally stable ones, please)
- ⅔ cup sour cream (surprisingly not a mistake)
- ⅔ cup heavy cream (extra cream for the cream god)

## Instructions
1.	Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). This is the only hot thing happening in your kitchen.
2.	Make the crust: In a bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, ¼ cup sugar, and melted butter. Press it into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan like you’re packing emotional baggage. Bake for 10 minutes. Let it cool.
3.	Mix the filling: Beat cream cheese until smooth, then add 1 cup sugar and vanilla. Continue beating like you’re trying to impress a stand mixer. Add eggs one at a time, mixing gently and wondering where you went wrong.
4.	Add sour cream and heavy cream. Stir it in until you get that unnervingly smooth consistency.
5.	Pour the batter into the cooled crust. Swirl it a little if you’re feeling chaotic.
6.	Bake in a water bath for 50-60 minutes, until the center is just slightly jiggly—like your confidence.
7.	Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake sit inside with the door cracked for 1 hour. Yes, you just leave it there. It’s called “passive culinary neglect.”
8.	Chill the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or overnight if you want to pretend you have patience.
9.	Optional: top with fruit, whipped cream, or your tears of joy.
