# Data Science is like cooking

You 
- start with raw ingredients (**messy data**)
- clean and chop them (**preprocessing**)
- follow a recipe (**modeling pipeline**)
- hope the result isn't too salty (**overfit**)
- should not start with bad ingredients, because then not even the fanciest cooking will save the dish (**garbage in, garbage out**)
- may try out different spices (**hyperparameter tuning**) 
- let friends taste your dish (**evaluation**)
- hope that even strangers will like it  (**generalization to new data**).

In this spirit — and to celebrate the delicious mix of creativity, logic, and occasional chaos — we, the FH Kiel Data Science Programming class, proudly present: **THE DATA SCIENCE COOKBOOK**. Here, we will assemble our most loved recipes, in case we manage to beat the dangerous Git and Github monster.

Just to remind ourselves:

- When experimenting with risky ingredients, make sure to do it in a separate pot (**git branch**). If it works out, you can add it to the main dish (**git merge**). If it doesn't, just throw it away (**git branch -d**).
- Take regular notes about all ingredients and cooking steps that you do (**git commit**).  
- If you have added to much salt to your dish and already shared it with your friends, there is no way to take it back (**git reset**). Instead, add some sugar on top to balance it out (**git revert**)
- As a matter of politeness, don't add your secret ingredient to the main dish without asking the Chef first (**pull request**).
- If you would like to see more recipes or if you want some recipe to be improved please let us know (**Github Issue**)!

Happy cooking - happy gitting!
